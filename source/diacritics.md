## Special Diacritics

### Anusvar (ं) & Chandrabindu (ँ) 

#### Anusvar 

#### Anunasik/ Chandrabindu 

#### Practical Usage 

### Vrtmukhi (ॅ, ॉ)

This superscript semi-circle ihas become a very common diactritic to better represent the `e` (*tax*onomy) and `ɔː` (*doc*tor) sounds in English. These vowel sounds originally didn't exist in Hindi and the closest approximation can create confusion and mispronunciation.

| Source | Target (Wrong) | Target (Correct) |
| ------ | -------------- | ---------------- |
| Docker | डौकर/डाकर | डॉकर |
| Stack | स्टैक | स्टॅक |

For technical terms where the correct pronunciation of the word is important for communication, please use ॅ instead of े/ै and ॉ instead of ो/ौ.

### Nukta (़)

This is also used to accurately transcribe the soft `f` sound from English and the soft `z` found in English and Arabic/Persian in loan words.

Again important to use the nukta correctly when transcribing technical terms and loan words. Without it, apart from the pronunciation, the spelling of a lot of words is considered incorrect.
