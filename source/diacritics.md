## Special Diacritics

### Anusvar (ं) & Chandrabindu (ँ) 

#### Anusvar 

#### Anunasik/ Chandrabindu 

#### Practical Usage 

### Vrtmukhi (ॅ, ॉ)

This superscript semi-circle ihas become a very common diactritic to better represent the `e` (*tax*onomy) and `ɔː` (*doc*tor) sounds in English. These vowel sounds originally didn't exist in Hindi and the closest approximation can create confusion and mispronunciation.

For technical terms where the correct pronunciation of the word is important for communication, please use ॅ instead of े/ै and ॉ instead of ो/ौ.
