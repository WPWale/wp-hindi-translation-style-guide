## Special Diacritics

### Anusvar (ं) & Chandrabindu (ँ) 

#### Anusvar 

#### Anunasik/ Chandrabindu 

#### Practical Usage 

### Vrtmukhi (ॅ, ॉ)

This superscript semi-circle ihas become a very common diactritic to better represent the `e` (*tax*onomy) and `ɔː` (*doc*tor) sounds in English. These vowel sounds originally didn't exist in Hindi and the closest approximation can create confusion and mispronunciation.

| Source | Target (Wrong) | Target (Correct) |
| ------ | -------------- | ---------------- |
| Docker | डौकर/डाकर | डॉकर |
| Stack | स्टैक | स्टॅक |

For technical terms where the correct pronunciation of the word is important for communication, please use ॅ instead of े/ै and ॉ instead of ो/ौ.

### Nukta (़)

This is also used to accurately transcribe the soft `f` sound from English and the soft `z` found in English and Arabic/Persian in loan words.

| ------ | -------------- | ---------------- |
| Feed (as in RSS) | फीड | फ़ीड |
| Valid | जायज | जायज़ |
| File | फाइल | फ़ाइल |
| Document | दस्तावेज | दस्तावेज़ |

Again important to use the nukta correctly when transcribing technical terms and loan words. Without it, apart from the pronunciation, the spelling of a lot of words is considered incorrect.

#### `ʒ` sound and श़

`ʒ` (~ zh) is a sound that doesn't exist in Hindi. Phonetically it's a voiced version of a `ʃ` (sh) sound and that's why some authorities like [Wikipedia](https://hi.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%B8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AF_%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%BE:BernardM) use `श़` to represent this sound.

| Source | Target (Wrong) | Target (Correct) |
| ------ | -------------- | ---------------- |
| Treasure | ट्रेजर/ट्रेज़र | ट्रेश़र |
| Version | वर्जन/वर्शन/वर्ज़न | वर्श़न |

Please follow this convention for transcribing such words.
