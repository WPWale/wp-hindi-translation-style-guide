## 1. General Guidelines

More detailed & general guidelines for translators of all languages are in the official WordPress [Translator's Handbook](https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/). It is recommended to read the handbook before reading this guide. It contains a lot of technicalities and tools. This guide contains things specific to Hindi translation.

> Note: A basic understanding of [types of translation](https://github.com/WPWale/wp-hindi-translation-style-guide/blob/draft/docs/types-translation.md) is needed to understand these.

Even before devising a full style guide, the author feels that if translators follow a few basic principles, they won't need to refer a formal guide. A guide would, in fact, become a barrier in productivity if you had to look it up again and again. Keeping this in mind, think of this as a TLDR; version of the whole guide.

### 1.1. Human, not Machine

Machines like Google translate provide [Word-for-Word](https://github.com/WPWale/wp-hindi-translation-style-guide/blob/master/docs/types-translation.md#1-word-for-word-translation) and/or [Literal](https://github.com/WPWale/wp-hindi-translation-style-guide/blob/master/docs/types-translation.md#2-literal-translation) translations. Such translations can be really useful for translators to analyse and understand the original string. They can also be used to find synonyms for difficult word.

Beyond that, simply copy-pasting their output is lazy, useless and a waste of time for translators, editors and users alike. Why spend your time doing something that could have been done with an API?

### 1.2. Communicative, not Literal

Translating does not meaning taking a sentence and replacing it word by word with its Hindi equivalent. Instead, think of what meaning the sentence is trying to convey to a user, in the given context and what is the user expected to do as a result of reading the text. It doesn't matter if the text is completely different from the original as long as it conveys the context, meaning and intentions.

### 1.3. Functionality, not Linguistic Pride

Yes, Hindi is a great language with a great history and it is absolutely okay to be proud of your linguistic heritage and tradition. 

However, a software is built for a purpose and anything that interferes with its functionality and usage is going to be counter-productive. Just because the translation of a word exists in Hindi doesn't mean we must use it. Translating `keyboard` to `कुंजि-पटल` is probably a greater disservice to Hindi because it'll confuse users and prevent them from using WordPress in Hindi. What are you more likely to say at a computer hardware store? *"एक कुंजि-पटल और मूषक-यंत्र देना।"* or *"एक कीबोर्ड और माउस देना।"*?

What works in an [academic or creative context](https://github.com/WPWale/wp-hindi-translation-style-guide/blob/master/docs/types-translation.md#for-creative-reproduction--detailed-explanation) would probably not work for a software that is expected to be used by people of all kinds of educational, social and cultural backgrounds. Always think of what is more likely to be used in a day-to-day conversational setting than what should go in a formal textbook or official circular/notice. 

Think about what is more important – creating a version of WordPress that is un-understandable and useless for the general population or creating a non-dogmatic version that's easier to use and adopt which will lead to the publishing and availability of tonnes of content in Hindi! What do you think will help the cause of Hindi more?
