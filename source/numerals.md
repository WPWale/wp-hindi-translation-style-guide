## 5. Numerals

International numerals are derived from Indian numerals via Arabic numerals and the decimal system also comes from India so we don't have any deviation.

Although Devnagari numerals(०,१,२,३,४,५,६,७,८,९) exist, they are hardly used except in strict formal texts and most native Hindi speakers wouldn't recognise some of those numbers (4 onwards). Also, the numbers are written differently in different parts by different people. Commonly, for all practical purposes, international numerals are used instead.

So, we stick to that for translations and only use international numerals (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9).


### 5.1 Numbering System

The [Indian numbering system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_numbering_system) is different from the Western numbering system for expressing numbers larger than ten thousands. Lakhs (लाख) & crores (करोड़) are used in place of millions and billions. Although, there are words for numbers larger than a crore (arabs and kharabs), generally such numbers are expressed in crores.


| Western numbering system | Indian numbering system |
| :----------------------: | :---------------------: |
| 10,000 (Ten thousand)    | 10,000 (दस हज़ार)        |
| 100,000 (Hundred thousand) | 1,00,000 (एक लाख)    |
| 1,000,000 (One million)  | 10,00,000 (दस लाख)     |
| 10,000,000 (Ten million)  | 1,00,00,000 (एक करोड़) |
| 1,000,000,000 (One billion)| 1,00,00,00,000 (सौ करोड़, ~~एक अरब~~)|
| 100,000,000,000 (Hundred billion)| 1,00,00,00,00,000 (दस हज़ार करोड़, ~~एक खरब~~)|
