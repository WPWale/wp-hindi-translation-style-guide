## 4. Text Conventions

### 4.1. Abbreviations

### 4.2. Acronymns

### 4.3. Names

#### 4.3.1 People

Names of people should be simply transliterated instead of translated, even if an apparent equivalent name exists in general culture.

| Source | Target (Wrong) | Target (Correct) |
| ------ | -------------- | ---------------- |
| Uthman | उस्मान | उथमान | 
| Mary | मेरी | मॅरी |
| Socrates | सुकरात | सॉक्रेटेस |
| Johny | जानी | जॉनी |

#### 4.3.2 Brand Names

#### 4.3.3 Keyboard Keys

#### 4.3.4 Others

Cultural names like names of places, religions, cultures, languages, etc often have a Hindi version. When available use them instead of simply transliterating: 

| Source | Target (Wrong) | Target (Correct) |
| ------ | -------------- | ---------------- |
| American | अमेरीकन | अमरीकी |
| Egypt | इजिप्ट | मिस्र |
| Indian | इंडियन | भारतीय |
| Italian | इटॅलियन | इतालवी |
| Chinese | चाइनीज़ | चीनी |
| South Korean | साउथ कोरियन | दक्षिण कोरियाई |

### 4.4. Legal Texts & Licenses

There is some sort of license and other legal statements distributed with software. WordPress contains a `license.txt` in its root folder. The wording of such texts is chosen very carefully and is binding in a court of law. Which is why such texts shouldn't be replaced by a translation, however good it may be. So, [don't translate](https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/translating/working-with-core/#do-not-translate) legal texts and licenses.
