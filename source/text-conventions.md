### 4.4. Legal Texts & Licenses

There is some sort of license and other legal statements distributed with software. WordPress contains a `license.txt` in its root folder. The wording of such texts is chosen very carefully and is binding in a court of law. Which is why such texts shouldn't be replaced by a translation, however good it may be. So, [don't translate](https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/translating/working-with-core/#do-not-translate) legal texts and licenses.
