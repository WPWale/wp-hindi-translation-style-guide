## 3. Punctuations

The predecessor mother language of Hindi, Sanskrit has no punctuation except `।` (full-stop/end of sentence, पूर्ण-विराम) and `।।` (end of paragraph, दीर्घ-विराम). That's because Sanskrit has unique properties because of which it just [doesn't need punctuation](https://uttishthabharata.wordpress.com/2011/08/27/sanskrit-punctuation/). So, the punctuation used in Hindi is the same as English, except for a few cases described below.

### 3.1. Full-Stop

The `।` (khadi pai/ danda) is used instead of a full-stop. Usage of the full-stop itself is acceptable generally but it is recomended that this rule remains consistent throught the body of work. In WordPress, we use `।` everywhere.

### 3.2. Capitalisation & UPPERCASE

The Devnagari script doesn't have the concept of lower and upper cases. In English, cases are used to highlight letters and heavily emphasise words (to indicate loudness/ shouting). (WordPress is an example!)

The general recommendation is to increase the font-size for uppercase text (to indicate shouting) and ignore capitalisation. Since translators don't have access to font-size, it is recommended to use inverted commas for fully uppercase words. Capitalisations can be ignored safely. So WordPress becomes वर्डप्रेस with no highlights.

### 3.3. Colon (:)

A colon (`:`) is used before a list or an explanation that follows. Since there is a character Visarga
(`:`) in Hindi similar to colon, to avoid confusion we use long dash (`–`) instead of the English colon.
