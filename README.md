# A Style Guide for translating WordPress into Hindi

An attempt to create a sensible style guide for translating WordPress to Hindi.

## Branches

 1. The latest version under development is always under the `draft` branch. All contributions must be made to this branch.
 1. The `master` branch is expected to contain the [latest stable (complete) guide](https://github.com/WPWale/wp-hindi-translation-style-guide/blob/master/dist/guide.md). Actual releases can be found versioned and tagged appropriately.

## Directory Structure

 1. `docs` contains useful documentation and other stuff that can't be put into the guide for any reason.
 1. `source` contains individual sections from the guide into separate files. All contributions must be made to the files in `source` and not to the full guide. The guide is built via an automatic build process.
 1. `dist` contains the full guide created by combining the individual sections in the `source` folder.
